                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why Software Engingeering?</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">March 27, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>Programming has been a skill on my bucket list since I could remember. I admire people who has the know-how, so much so I’ve married to a programer.</p>
                        <p>I had a few attempts at learning to code in school ages, however found extremely challenging getting my head around it and applying what I’ve learnt to solve real world problems. During my university years, I’ve even changed my major from Electrical/electronics to Mechatronics halfway through the degree because I’m struggling with courses like Embeded System. But why again and why now?</p>

                        <h5>Ability to create</h5>
                        <p>Able to design, create and improve something is a powerful capability and something I desire. This is why I’ve studied engineering. Unfortunately with the decline of Australian manufacturing, it is very rare to get a job where you can actually engineer a product. Most of people like myself, after graduate got into a technical role and acting as the knowledge link between oversea’s engineers and local technicians.</p>
                        <p>However, making something my own has always been in my hart. I’m hoping giving learn to code another shot will allow me one day able to just sit down and write an application. No longer stuck just wondering what could be and what if.</p>

                        <h5>Highly transferable skill</h5>
                        <p>Been a manager myself, when hiring for an experienced position, I would often only interview those with relevant experiences. Have you worked in the same industry? Perhaps even on products with similar technical attributes?</p>
                        <p>Unlike many other disciplines, programming is a much transferable skill, which means boarder career options with wider range of industries. Because it is also in high demand the fear of never getting a job is nonexistent. Worse comes to worst, you can always find project based contract works.</p>

                        <h5>Career progression & benefits</h5>
                        <p>My day are filled with meetings, handling escalations (and only escalations) and coaching others. Higher pay often comes with additional responsibilities and sacrifices in personal life. While I’m already earning in six-figures and happy with my package (for now), it is still significantly lower than my programer husband. We are young parents with a three year old. It bothers me time to time my husband is able to spend more time with my son.</p>
                        <p>Looking around, become a programer seems like a great alternative. After gaining a couple of years field experiences, it is highly likely to land a midlevel job, getting the same pay as I’m currently on without been in a management role. To tip it up, full remote and flexibility is no longer a dream.</p>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 0 Portfolio Project Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 3, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>Now I’ve started a software engineering bootcamp course with Academy Xi, the first project we have at the end of Phase 0 is to host a personal website on GitHub. Apart from the project, we were also required to publish two blogs sharing the reasons of studying software engineering, as well as any reflection had during this initial phase and on the project of building this website. I then thought to myself, what is better then combine them all and build a website to host those blogs. What you are about to read are my reflections of the experience so far.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1) What went well? Key Learning.</h5>
                        <p>In the last three weeks, we’ve completed a number of labs, got introduced to GitHub and the basics of HTML and CSS. Everything went quite smooth when following guidance provided, initialising repositories and creating basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
                        <p>Having a husband working in this field definitly helps. He suggested me to start my website utilising free front-end open source toolkit such as Bootstrap. Following steps below, I was able to have a jump start at laying out my website.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added meta tags for better mobile experience to &lt;head&gt;.</li>
                            <li>Linked Bootstrap CCS stylesheet and followed by a local style.css file, which gives me the flexibility of applying existing stylings from Bootstrap and override with mines when needed.</li>
                            <li>Started HTML content from a Magazine line blog template on Bootstrap by inspecting its elements.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>2) What could have been improved?</h5>
                        <p>Evidently writing blog content directly into a HTML file, especically with the index.html isn’t user friendly. Even when the only user is me, it is definitely not my prefered long term solution. Hoping as I progress with the course, rather than editing codes directly, my website will include blog templates and back-end server to allow posting new blogs directly onto the site.</p>
                        <p>On top of that, as there is only one HTML file, most of the links on the site are going nowhere. Will need to work on enrich contents on the website. A few ideas to start with are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Store actual blogs on individule pages and access them via links on featured posts or in archives section.</li>
                            <li>Expend the use of the website to store other files such as my CV, and add navigation bar to the header to access different contents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Looking at the process alone, what could have been done better is to have smaller commits more frequently. After commit with bootstrap stylesheet, I got carried away with creating the content and adjusting styles using the opened HTML file. No additional commit were added until the initial site was pretty much finished.</p>

                        <h5>3) The key take aways.</h5>
                        <p>Here are some key learnings from this eventful initial phase.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read, I mean READ error messages. The fix to the error is often in the message.</li>
                            <li>Do not get caught on what people were telling you to do. There are many good ways at solving a problem. I got stuck in one of the lab where Column structure were suggested. It was until I decided to use Grid layout after many days of trials and failures with Columns, I finally had something I’m happy with.</li>
                            <li>Smaller and more frequent commits.</li>
                            <li>Utilise tools and learn from other’s codes. Bootstrap is powerful, so is inspecting website codes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>4) The process you followed?</h5>
                        <p>Step by step instructions provided by Academy Xi in this course has been very guiding the overall process of completing this project. </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Local repository folder and remote GitHub repository were created.</li>
                            <li>Connected remote to the local repository and created README.md.</li>
                            <li>Added basic index.html, style.css and script.js files.</li>
                            <li>Published the website via GitHub Pages.</li>
                            <li>Connected Bootstrap stylesheet & scripts.</li>
                            <li>Built HTML layout utilising blog example on Bootstrap and customised components.</li>
                            <li>Overrode certain styles.</li>
                            <li>Finally. adding blogs like NOW!</li>
                        </ol>
