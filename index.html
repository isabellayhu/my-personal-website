                        <p class="blog-post-meta">March 27, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>Programming has been a skill on my bucket list since I could remember. I admire people who has the know-how, so much so I’ve married to a programer.</p>
                        <p>I had a few attempts at learning to code in school ages, however found extremely challenging getting my head around it and applying what I’ve learnt to solve real world problems. During my university years, I’ve even changed my major from Electrical/electronics to Mechatronics halfway through the degree because I’m struggling with courses like Embeded System. But why again and why now?</p>

                        <h5>Ability to create</h5>
                        <p>Able to design, create and improve something is a powerful capability and something I desire. This is why I’ve studied engineering. Unfortunately with the decline of Australian manufacturing, it is very rare to get a job where you can actually engineer a product. Most of people like myself, after graduate got into a technical role and acting as the knowledge link between oversea’s engineers and local technicians.</p>
                        <p>However, making something my own has always been in my hart. I’m hoping giving learn to code another shot will allow me one day able to just sit down and write an application. No longer stuck just wondering what could be and what if.</p>

                        <h5>Highly transferable skill</h5>
                        <p>Been a manager myself, when hiring for an experienced position, I would often only interview those with relevant experiences. Have you worked in the same industry? Perhaps even on products with similar technical attributes?</p>
                        <p>Unlike many other disciplines, programming is a much transferable skill, which means boarder career options with wider range of industries. Because it is also in high demand the fear of never getting a job is nonexistent. Worse comes to worst, you can always find project based contract works.</p>

                        <h5>Career progression & benefits</h5>
                        <p>My day are filled with meetings, handling escalations (and only escalations) and coaching others. Higher pay often comes with additional responsibilities and sacrifices in personal life. While I’m already earning in six-figures and happy with my package (for now), it is still significantly lower than my programer husband. We are young parents with a three year old. It bothers me time to time my husband is able to spend more time with my son.</p>
                        <p>Looking around, become a programer seems like a great alternative. After gaining a couple of years field experiences, it is highly likely to land a midlevel job, getting the same pay as I’m currently on without been in a management role. To tip it up, full remote and flexibility is no longer a dream.</p>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 0 Portfolio Project Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 3, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>Now I’ve started a software engineering bootcamp course with Academy Xi, the first project we have at the end of Phase 0 is to host a personal website on GitHub. Apart from the project, we were also required to publish two blogs sharing the reasons of studying software engineering, as well as any reflection had during this initial phase and on the project of building this website. I then thought to myself, what is better then combine them all and build a website to host those blogs. What you are about to read are my reflections of the experience so far.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1) What went well? Key Learning.</h5>
                        <p>In the last three weeks, we’ve completed a number of labs, got introduced to GitHub and the basics of HTML and CSS. Everything went quite smooth when following guidance provided, initialising repositories and creating basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
                        <p>Having a husband working in this field definitly helps. He suggested me to start my website utilising free front-end open source toolkit such as Bootstrap. Following steps below, I was able to have a jump start at laying out my website.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added meta tags for better mobile experience to &lt;head&gt;.</li>
                            <li>Linked Bootstrap CCS stylesheet and followed by a local style.css file, which gives me the flexibility of applying existing stylings from Bootstrap and override with mines when needed.</li>
                            <li>Started HTML content from a Magazine line blog template on Bootstrap by inspecting its elements.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>2) What could have been improved?</h5>
                        <p>Evidently writing blog content directly into a HTML file, especically with the index.html isn’t user friendly. Even when the only user is me, it is definitely not my prefered long term solution. Hoping as I progress with the course, rather than editing codes directly, my website will include blog templates and back-end server to allow posting new blogs directly onto the site.</p>
                        <p>On top of that, as there is only one HTML file, most of the links on the site are going nowhere. Will need to work on enrich contents on the website. A few ideas to start with are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Store actual blogs on individule pages and access them via links on featured posts or in archives section.</li>
                            <li>Expend the use of the website to store other files such as my CV, and add navigation bar to the header to access different contents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Looking at the process alone, what could have been done better is to have smaller commits more frequently. After commit with bootstrap stylesheet, I got carried away with creating the content and adjusting styles using the opened HTML file. No additional commit were added until the initial site was pretty much finished.</p>

                        <h5>3) The key take aways.</h5>
                        <p>Here are some key learnings from this eventful initial phase.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read, I mean READ error messages. The fix to the error is often in the message.</li>
                            <li>Do not get caught on what people were telling you to do. There are many good ways at solving a problem. I got stuck in one of the lab where Column structure were suggested. It was until I decided to use Grid layout after many days of trials and failures with Columns, I finally had something I’m happy with.</li>
                            <li>Smaller and more frequent commits.</li>
                            <li>Utilise tools and learn from other’s codes. Bootstrap is powerful, so is inspecting website codes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>4) The process you followed?</h5>
                        <p>Step by step instructions provided by Academy Xi in this course has been very guiding the overall process of completing this project. </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Local repository folder and remote GitHub repository were created.</li>
                            <li>Connected remote to the local repository and created README.md.</li>
                            <li>Added basic index.html, style.css and script.js files.</li>
                            <li>Published the website via GitHub Pages.</li>
                            <li>Connected Bootstrap stylesheet & scripts.</li>
                            <li>Built HTML layout utilising blog example on Bootstrap and customised components.</li>
                            <li>Overrode certain styles.</li>
                            <li>Finally. adding blogs like NOW!</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 1 Portfolio Project Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 29, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>Here comes the my second project of the software engineering bootcamp, we’ve been challenged to build a single page application to allow interactions with data from a public API. During initial planning, I had two ideas with similar concept, where the web application will take a location, either return its weather details or put a pin on the map.</p>
                        <P>My great dreams had soon woken by hash realities. Upon investigating a number of weather and map APIs, I came to the realisation that all of them require geographic coordinates as input parameters. Consider my skill level and time constrains on the project, choices became:</P>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>User to enter geo coordinates and the APP returns weather details or map location.</strong>This would be more aligned with my original vision, but requires high user effort to have the geo-coordinates before able to use the APP. Meaning more trouble for me when it comes to demo time. On top of that, properly displaying weather icons and maps would be a different level of challenge.</li>
                            <li><strong>User to look up a location by name and the APP returns its geographic coordinates.</strong>Nothing fancy, but satisfies the project requirements and can be built on in the future if I still want a map out of it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The preference was clear and decision was quick. I went with the 2nd option and please welcome to my very first APP - <a href="https://isabellayhu.github.io/JS-Project-API/">Coordinates Finder</a>. As you typing up a location name, it will come up with some locations matches/suggestions for you to select. Once selected, you can click search icon to find its coordinates.</p>

                        <h5>1) What went well? Key Learning.</h5>
                        <p>Took learnings from last project, I’ve again linked my html with Bootstrap’s stylesheet. But this time, I’ve also spent sometime looked into its forms docs and unitised it’s search icon. When it came to coding time, my frontend form was completed rather smoothly with very limited style overwrites required.</p>
                        <p>After created remote repository, instead of then create the local directory and link them together, this time, I simply used ‘git clone’. Works a treat!</p>

                        <h5>2) What could have been improved?</h5>
                        <p>If time allows, there are a couple of issues I’d like to fix.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After user selected the best match address, the APP would still update and provide a list of suggestions based on the address selected. Would be good to stop the ‘fetchSuggestion()’ function once an option is selected.</li>
                            <li>If when user types in a location, but presses enter or search icon without selecting any of suggested options, the APP would run into an Uncaught TypeError as the search key not matching with any of the stored results. However, nothing would happen in the frontend. The ideal outcome in such situation would be either an alert pops up asking user to select an option listed or return coordinates of 1st option when nothing is selected.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Style wise, a more obvious feedback indicating a search is completed would be nice. A randomly updated background image is also a cool idea.</p>

                        <h5>3) The key take aways.</h5>
                        <p>Some interesting findings through this project.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The ‘debugger’ statement and ‘console.log()’ have been useful in this project. In particular when inspecting fetched data from API.</li>
                            <li>When working with ‘keyup’ event and creating options, ‘replaceChild()’ should be used instead of ‘appendChild()’ otherwise you would end up a very long list of options.</li>
                            <li>To avoid getting confused with the forever growing variables, visualising functions as building blocks with input and output. Limiting too many global variables and concentrate on variables within a function really helps.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 2 Portfolio Project Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">July 17, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>We’ve now been introduced to React. Same as the Javascript phase, we’ve again been assigned a project to build a single page application using data from an external API, however this time using React.</p>
                        <P>Instead of working on a new idea, I’ve decided to again build a Coordinate Finder APP same as last project with some additional features (listed).</P>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home/welcome route to access the APP.</li>
                            <li>Save function to post coordinates result to a JSON mock up backend server.</li>
                            <li>Record file route to view those saved places.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>1) What went well? Key Learning.</h5>
                        <p>As an improvement from last project, a randomly updated background image been added to this APP. To ensure contents are clearly displayed over the background image, a white transparent ‘Card’ was added as a container for the body of the APP.</p>
                        <p>Yarn was used for this project and turned out to be a great replacement of NPM. It performs much faster when comes to package installations, with no security vulnerability warnings like when using NPM.</p>
                        <p>I’ve also been introduced to a useful Chrome DevTools extension for React, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en">React Developer Tools</a>. Its Components tab shows all components rendered in a tree with their current props and state. </p>

                        <h5>2) What could have been improved?</h5>
                        <p>At this stage, the APP and its mock up backend server are only running in development mode. Ideally would be good to deploy the APP for public use. Until then, others will need to fork the repository, then use ‘yarn start’ & ‘yarn json-server’ to run the APP. Alternatively for anyone who is interested to see the APP running, here is a demo video:</p>
                        <iframe src="https://flip.com/s/Q3Nm3_bHbhnd" title="Demo: React Coordinate Finder APP" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>Function wise, the APP currently allows you to save empty records, which should’ve been rejected or ignored.</p>

                        <h5>3) The key take aways.</h5>
                        <p>Here are some key learnings from this project.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Previously discovered short cut where first create remote repository then git clone local directory, to avoid those steps of creating local directory and connecting with the remote GitHub repository, does not work when using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> generator to create a new APP.</li>
                            <li>Always look for the latest documentations. For instance, with the use of <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">react-router</a> the latest documentation link provided is for dom v4, where ‘Switch’ component no longer work and was replaced by ‘Routes’ in its latest upgrade v6.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>4) The process you followed?</h5>
                        <p>Steps I went through creating this APP are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Setup basic file structure using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>.</li>
                            <li>Created a remote repository on GitHub and connected with the local repository.</li>
                            <li>Installed <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">react-router-dom</a> and added Home & Main routes.</li>
                            <li>Installed <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">react-bootstrap</a>, react-bootstrap-icons and imported Bootstrap stylesheet.</li>
                            <li>Added basic html elements (header, navigation, forms & buttons) to Home and Main components.</li>
                            <li>Created SearchForm and ResultForm child components in Main.</li>
                            <li>Added a fetch function in SearchForm to query geographic data from <a href="https://mapbox.com">Mapbox Geocoding API</a> when changes are made to the search bar.</li>
                            <li>Created DataList child component in SearchForm, rendering search suggestions from the fetched data.</li>
                            <li>Update & pass state values back to Main to be accessed by ResultForm when SearchForm is submitted.</li>
                            <li>Display geo-coordinates in ResultForm.</li>
                            <li>Created a mock up backend using ’yarn add json-server --dev’ and posting places results when the Save button is clicked.</li>
                            <li>Introduced a new SavedPlaces route to the App to display backend data in a table.</li>
                            <li>Finally finished the App with some background styling.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 3 Portfolio Project Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">September, 2022 by Isabella</p>

                        <p>We’ve been learning Ruby in this phase. While we need to again utilize data from an external API, project for this phase is asking to build Command Line Interface (CLI) application instead. You probably have guessed it, I’ve build the Coordinate Finder APP again using the same Mapbox Geocoding API.</p>
                        <P>Here is the link to the repository (<a href="http://github.com/isabellayhu/CLI-app">CLI APP</a>)</P>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The user will first be asked to enter a name or address to see a list of places matching that search text.</li>
                            <li>User can then key a Place ID from that list to view the coordinates of that place.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>1) What went well? Key Learning.</h5>
                        <p>Without concerning much over the visual presentation, this project was completed rather quickly.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the project, Mentor walked us through a simple example, which helped as a jump start for my codings. Two key discoveries from that sessions are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Test-driven development (TDD), i.e. adding APP feature begins by writing its test. It focus on user cases and requirements before code. </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, an API platform. While it has many features for building and using APIs, in this particular project, I’ve used Postman to view API responses, help setting my class attributes and arranging test data.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>2) What could have been improved?</h5>
                        <p>An error message has been included in the 2nd step, when the ID user entered does not match with any of the Place IDs listed, APP will return a message “Place ID not found!”.</p>
                        <p>However, it would be good if 1st step could also include some designed errors. At the moment when nothing matches with the search text, APP would return an empty list and still move to the next step asking to enter a Place ID. In certain scenarios, it will even return a long system error indicating the URI is invalid. Ideally, if there is no API response with the search text, a more descriptive error message should be displayed to instruct user to enter a different search text.  </p>

                        <h5>3) The key take aways.</h5>
                        <p>Here are some key learnings from this project.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Class vs Instance methods: Class methods are always defined as “def self.method_name” whereas Instance methods do not come with the “self.”. By definition and in this project, Class methods are used to fetch & convert API responses into a collection of objects, i.e. places. Instance methods are then used to find and print those places instances.</li>
                            <li>break vs exit statements: exit statement stops the whole program while the break statement allows us to continue the rest of the program outside of the loop. In this project, break statement is used to go back to the place list search step.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>4) The process you followed?</h5>
                        <p>Steps I went through creating this APP are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Created a remote repository on GitHub and created local repository using ‘git clone’.</li>
                            <li>Created Gemfile and installed gems.</li>
                            <li>Configured the environment.</li>
                            <li>Added basic APP features using TDD process, introduced Place class, method fetch API responses, method to construct a list of places and method to get place details.</li>
                            <li>Created bin/places for user interface.</li>
                            <li>Separated and refined classes, new classes Mapbox and PlaceCollections are introduced, as well as instance methods to find and print places.</li>
                            <li>Added exit and go back features.</li>
                            <li>Created README file with instructions on how to use the APP.</li>
                        </ol>
